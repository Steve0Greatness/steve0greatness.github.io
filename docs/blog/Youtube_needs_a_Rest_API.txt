Youtube needs an open Rest API. Here are some reasons:<ol><li>It makes my life easier, as I don't need to write a billion lines of code, and not go throught the <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">paid service</span> known as google cloud console, to get an api key.</li><li>It means that you only need to use <span class="code">fetch()</span> on it.</li><li>We don't need the most in depth api.</li></ol>
