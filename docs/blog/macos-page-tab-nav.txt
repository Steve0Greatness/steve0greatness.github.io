title: Page Keyboard Navigation on MacOS

Ok, so I feel like a complete idiot right now.

When I've been trying(and failing) to use the <span class="code">tab</span> key on my computer(it's a Macbook) for what feels like forever now. Turns out, it was as simple as hitting <span class="code">control + fn + &lt;&lt;</span>(<span class="code">&lt;&lt;</span> is <span class="code">F7</span>).

To be honest, I thought that it was just an issue with FireFox, and then I read [Browser keyboard navigation in macOS](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/macos-browser-keyboard-navigation/) and realized that it was an issue with MacOS! This should really be an option enabled by default, but Apple is stupid.
