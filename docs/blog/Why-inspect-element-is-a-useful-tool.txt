<div class="notice">This post isn't very good, and I'm not proud of it.</div>So, as of currently, my <a href="https://ocular.jeffalo.net/user/Steve0Greatness">Ocular Status</a> is <span style="font-style: italic; color: #0dbfb7; background-color: #0f0f0f;">Mobile needs a better browser! #MobileSmartBrowser! (Er/Him)</span>. Part of the reason for this is so that inspect can be on mobile.<p>but what makes inspect so important?</p>Well I'm glad I asked!<div>So on GitHub, you only have 2000 actions you can do(on the free plan). So that means you need to use them carefully, make sure that you won't do something that wastes an action.</div>It helps you fix any mistake, before you make anymore. <div>Of course, you can always download the file, and edit it offline. But inspect element is easier, live, and requires less space in your hard-drive.</div>Thanks for coming to my Ted-talk.ðŸ˜œðŸ¤ª
