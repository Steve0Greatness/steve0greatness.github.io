    <div class="notice">This post isn't very good, and I'm not proud of it.</div><div class="notice">This post is not fact, the word problems are wrong, and it would never be x*0, rather, it would be 0*x</div>So, lets say you own a hotel(just go along with it).<p>You have 2 rooms, and 0 people, if each room gets an equal amount of people(not including decimals, you can't have half, or a quarter of a person without them being dead)<div>common sense would tell you that you need that there would be 0 people in each room, right? Wrong, and now ever mathematician in the world will hunt you down.</div>Wait, if that's not correct, what is the right answer? Thanks for asking... me. The answer is, infinity... but why?</p>Well, according to the mathematicians, it's because you can fit infinite 0s of people into 1 room.<div>It's weird... I know. So why don't we correct this? Because the mathematicians decided that x/0=infinity... and ifyou know one, you'd know that they don't really like to be corrected. But we can still correct, we just need to get the current mathematician out of their seats... hm...</div>
