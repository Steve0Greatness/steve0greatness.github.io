title: MacOS Keyboard Navigation

Ok, so I feel like a complete idiot right now.

I've been trying to use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate webpages on my MacBook for what feels like forever now. Turns out, it was as simple as hitting <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F7</kbd></kbd>.

To be honest, I thought that it was just an issue with FireFox, and then I read [Browser keyboard navigation in macOS](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/macos-browser-keyboard-navigation/) by [Scott Vinkle](https://scottvinkle.me/) for [The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/) and realized that it was an issue with MacOS! This should really be enabled by default, but Apple is stupid.

Just thought I'd share this encase anyone else was having this issue.
