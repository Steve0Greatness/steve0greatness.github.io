title: About my Username
date: 2024 Mar 13

There's a lot of information about my username. So I thought I'd make this blog post to explain basically everything about it.

## Pronounciation

The pronounciation is Steve (/stiːv/) Zero (/ˈzɪərəʊ/, /ˈzɪroʊ/, or /ˈziroʊ/) Greatness (/ˈɡɹeɪtnəs/).

    Oh no! Your browser does not support audio controls. Maybe try <a href="/blog-files/Steve0Greatness-Pronounciation.oga">downloading the audio file</a>?

## History

Fun fact: when it was still I around, I was fairly active on [Blocksworld](https://blocksworld.com/). If you don't know: Blocksworld is a sandbox, similar to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), but in 3D.

On Blocksworld, I went by the username *Steve's Greatness*. This name was because I really liked Minecraft(hence the Steve) and the Greatness... is because I really liked Minecraft, and I thought it was great.

Eventually, when signing up for Scratch, to my dismay they didn't allow apostrophes or spaces. As a result: I decided to use a 0 inplace of the "'s ", hence the name: *Steve0Greatness*.

You can still see remnants of this name original name: my [Replit username is *StevesGreatness*](https://replit.com/@StevesGreatness); and in 2020 I had made [a new Scratch account](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Steves_greatness), with intentions of moving there.
