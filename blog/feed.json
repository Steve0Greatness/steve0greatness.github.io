Password management is incredibly tricky, as anything you mess up could compromise your users' password(s). Thankfully, random websites you've never visited before have a pure HTML blog post from 2023 about that exact topic, and how to do it properly.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it's just this sequence of steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Generate a long random sequence of characters, this is called a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)\">salt</a></em>(generate for each user, do not use a master salt)</li>\n<li>Prepend(or append, it doesn't matter, just keep it consistent) this to the user's password</li>\n<li>Use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function\">hashing algorithm</a>, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2\">PBKDF2</a>, to generate a unique sequence of characters that will uniquely identify that password.</li>\n<li>Store the salt and hash in the same place, <em>do not</em> store the password on it's own.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And to check if a password is right, repeat the steps, except rather than generating a random sequence of characters, get the sequence of characters that you've stored along with the hash.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-do-this\">Why Do <em>This</em>?</h2>\n\n<p>You might be thinking: <em>That's a bit arbitrary innit?</em> And if you aren't then you can stop reading now.</p>\n\n<p>This method of storing passwords is the only way to ensure that you are securely storing them. So let's go through some other ways, and why they aren't so good.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"plaintext-passwords\">Plaintext Passwords</h3>\n\n<p>Storing your passwords in plaintext allows anyone who can get into your server to easily take any password they want, as no matter how good your users' password is, their account will be hacked if an unauthorized or malicious individual is able to get in.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"encrypted-passwords\">Encrypted Passwords</h3>\n\n<p>This is basically just plaintext with additional steps. As long as your master-key is stored somewhere, it will get stolen as soon as somebody manages to get into your system.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bare-hashing\">Bare Hashing</h3>\n\n<p>A hash isn't able to be undone, meaning theoretically you should be able to <em>just</em> hash your password. This, while a fair assumption, has unfortunately been incorrect for quite some time. There are databases online that store every word in the english language(or just some words) in addition to common passwords and their hashes, and users will often use words for their passwords, even though it's insecure.</p>\n\n<p>This is where salts come in. Due to the nature of hashes, even a single change in a string will entirely change it's hash, as such, if you add a random sequence of characters to a string, then you can entirely change it's hash.</p>\n", "date_published": "2023-11-02T00:00:00Z", "date_modified": "2023-11-02T00:00:00Z", "url": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/blog/How-to-Store-Passwords.html"}, {"id": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/blog/satisfactory-farming-idea.html", "title": "JSON Feed version 1.1", "icon": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/favicon.ico", "content_html": "<p>Here is my idea for automating the collection of healing materials(such as Beryl Nuts) in Satisfactory</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"plant-pods\">Plant Pods</h2>\n\n<p>Plant pods would be researchable in the Nutrients section of the MAM. It would cost:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>5 modular frames </li>\n<li>10 steel pipes</li>\n<li>20 biofuel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>to research.</p>\n\n<p>You'd be able to build it in a new <em>Farming</em> section in the production category of the build menu. It would cost the user:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>4 steel pipes</li>\n<li>2 quickwire</li>\n<li>5 biofuel</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>to build. It would require 1 MW of power to function. Plants that are left without power while in there will not continue growing or providing harvest, however they will not die(that'd be annoying if they did).</p>\n\n<p>The user would be able to interact with the planting pod to bring up a menu that tells them what stage of growing it's at(baby, growing, fully grown), how ripe for harvest the plant is(out of 3 states: none, starting, ripe). The UI will have a button to harvest at the bottom, and a box that will allow the plant to be exchanged for another--which would give you a few leaves, proportional to how long it's been growing(0 if baby, 4 if growing, 10 if fully grown), and the amount of fruit they would have gotten from the harvest + 1 extra(for the fruit they put in).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"robot-farmers\">Robot Farmers</h2>\n\n<p>Researchable under the <em>Crystal Oscillator</em>. The research cost is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>10 Crystal Oscillators</li>\n<li>5 AI limiter</li>\n<li>3 quickwire</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These little farmers need power to survive, which is why the <em>ROBOT charger</em> is unlocked with them.\nThis building can be built in the power section. They cost:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>15 quickwire</li>\n<li>2 modular frames</li>\n<li>5 crystal oscillators</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>to build.</p>\n\n<p>Once built, this building acts like the truck station, but instead of coal, it loads power, and it can only unload items from the bot's inventory.</p>\n\n<p>The Robo-Farmer is then buildable under the <em>Farming</em> section in the production category of the build menu. It costs:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1 Factory Cart</li>\n<li>2 Crystal Oscillators</li>\n<li>1 AI limiter</li>\n<li>3 quickwire</li>\n<li>5 steal pipes</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>to build.</p>\n\n<p>These little robots have themselves a little UI that allows you to select items they should farm. Once given a task, these robots will always return to the nearest <em>ROBOT charger</em> when their inventory is full, or they are running low on power(robots will always attempt to keep themselves powered). If the robot cannot find a plant within range that is harvestable, then the they will wait until there is one. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-the-most-out-of-these-resources\">Getting the most out of these resources</h2>\n\n<p>Robot Farmers are best at traversing on foundations(they spend less power). As such, it is recommended, that the player create a flat platform that has plant pods with some space between for the bots to traverse between them. In the center, the player should build a <em>ROBOT charger</em>, as it will allow the robots the run around equally in each direction. Players should also utilize the <em>Conveyor Lift</em> to bring materials to a layer above for sorting, or other purposes.</p>\n", "date_published": "2023-04-16T00:00:00Z", "date_modified": "2024-03-24T00:00:00Z", "url": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/blog/satisfactory-farming-idea.html"}, {"id": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/blog/tf2-disguise-cmd.html", "title": "JSON Feed version 1.1", "icon": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/favicon.ico", "content_html": "<p>A Spy class-specific command</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"layout\">Layout</h2>\n\n<p>The basic layout of the disguise command is very simple.</p>\n\n<pre><code>disguise [class] [team]\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"class-parameter\"><code>class</code> Parameter</h2>\n\n<p><code>1</code> : Scout</p>\n\n<p><code>2</code> : Sniper</p>\n\n<p><code>3</code> : Soldier</p>\n\n<p><code>4</code> : Demoman</p>\n\n<p><code>5</code> : Medic</p>\n\n<p><code>6</code> : Heavy</p>\n\n<p><code>7</code> : Pyro</p>\n\n<p><code>8</code> : Spy</p>\n\n<p><code>9</code> : Engineer</p>\n\n<p>The reason the classes are in this order is that they were added in that order.

You may just want a light and dark mode, however, you may also want other themes. As an example: a clown theme that makes the page absurdly colorful, like a GeoCities site in the early 2000s. For these themes, you can use CSS variables set on the <code>html</code> parent tag(all other elements are considered children of <code>html</code>). Variables can be set in CSS using double hyphens followed by a sequence of text that can use numbers(but not at the start), letters(capital or lowercase), underscores, and hyphens; these variables can then be accessed within your text using the <code>var()</code> function with the name of the variable(including the starting hyphens). You can change out the CSS variables using different selectors on the <code>html</code> tag within the CSS, for me: I'm using the <code>[data-theme]</code> attribute; however, you can use classes if you want. Here is the CSS I wrote:</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code><span class=\"nt\">html</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"nt\">data-theme</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nt\">light</span><span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">background</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#fff</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#000</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonBackground</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#fefefe</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonBorder</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#ccc</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonColor</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#001</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">html</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"nt\">data-theme</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nt\">dark</span><span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">background</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#000</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#fff</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonBackground</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#101010</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonBorder</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#333</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonColor</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#fff</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">html</span><span class=\"o\">[</span><span class=\"nt\">data-theme</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"nt\">hotdogstand</span><span class=\"o\">]</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">background</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#f00</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#fff</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonBackground</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#ff0</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonBorder</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#000</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonColor</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mh\">#000</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">button</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">background</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonBackground</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">border</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonBorder</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kc\">solid</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">3</span><span class=\"kt\">px</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">color</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nf\">var</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nv\">--buttonColor</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now we need to create a button that we will use to change the <code>[data-theme]</code> attribute. You (probably) already know what buttons are, so I won't go in depth about then. However: you will need to add an <code>[id]</code> to the button, this will come in play shortly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">button</span> <span class=\"na\">id</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;theme-switch&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>Switch Theme<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">button</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now, it is time to write the JavaScript. First, you'll want to make a constant with the themes you filled into your CSS, for me, that was <code>dark</code>, <code>light</code>, and <code>clown</code>. I'll name this <code>themes</code>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">const</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">themes</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;light&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;dark&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;hotdogstand&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">];</span>\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>We now need to query the <abbr title=\"Document Object Model\">DOM</abbr> for our theme switch button. This can be done in 2 ways: <code>document.querySelector</code> or <code>document.getElementById</code>; personally, I prefer <code>querySelector</code>, as it allows you to write a CSS selector to get an element from the DOM, allowing for shorter, more digestible, code.</p>\n\n<p>We have to add a click event to the button. This can be done in 2 ways within JavaScript: <code>addEventListener(\"click\", ...)</code> and <code>onclick</code>. I personally like <code>addEventListener</code> more, so I'll use that. Within the <code>addEventListener</code> function, you need to put a function. This function will control the logic of our theme switch. I'll call this function <code>SwitchTheme</code>, to reflect it's functionality.</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">const</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">ThemeSwitchButton</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nb\">document</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">querySelector</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;#theme-switch&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">ThemeSwitchButton</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">addEventListener</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">&quot;click&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">SwitchTheme</span><span class=\"p\">());</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">SwitchTheme</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{}</span>\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Explaining each part of this function as it's written out would take awhile, so instead, I'll add comments to the ends of each line giving a short explanation. Also, for the sake of shortness, I've placed <code>document.documentElement</code> inside the constant <code>HTML</code>, giving us access to the root element in the DOM(<code>html</code>).</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">CurrentTheme</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">themes</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">indexOf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">HTML</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">dataset</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">theme</span><span class=\"p\">);</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// Gets how far in the current theme is into the &quot;themes&quot; constant.</span>\n<span class=\"k\">if</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">CurrentTheme</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mf\">1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">&gt;=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">themes</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">length</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// Checks if it&#39;s at the end of the array,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nx\">HTML</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">dataset</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">theme</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">themes</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mf\">0</span><span class=\"p\">];</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// If so, reset at the start.</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"k\">return</span><span class=\"p\">;</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// Ends the function here, preventing next bit of code from running.</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"nx\">HTML</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">dataset</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">theme</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nx\">themes</span><span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"nx\">CurrentTheme</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">+</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mf\">1</span><span class=\"p\">];</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"c1\">// Goes to the next theme.</span>\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Now we have a finished product.

Using these is a little like making a list, if you've ever made one. Here's an example bit of HTML:</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">select</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">option</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>op 1<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">option</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">option</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>op 2<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">option</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">select</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Like all <code>input</code>s, <code>select</code> can have an id and name, and like <code>input[type=radio]</code>, <code>option</code> can have a value.</p>\n\n<p>However, you may not know some things that could be useful here, such as defaulting, or making things update upon being changed, well, you can do defaulting with <code>selected</code> in the <code>&lt;option&gt;</code> that you want to be preselected. Changes done the page upon the change of the selection in the drop-down(or anything else that can be changed by the user) is <code>onchange=\"submitFunction()\"</code> being placed in the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Let's check back on the code that we made at the code example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"codehilite\">\n<pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">select</span> <span class=\"na\">onchange</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;submitFunction()&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">id</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;selection&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">option</span> <span class=\"na\">value</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;op1&quot;</span> <span class=\"na\">selected</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>op 1<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">option</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nt\">option</span> <span class=\"na\">value</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">&quot;op2&quot;</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>op 2<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">option</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"p\">&lt;/</span><span class=\"nt\">select</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Inorder to access the selected option with JavaScript, use <code>document.getElementById(\"selection\").value</code>.</p>\n\n<p>That's basically it, feel free to <code>CTRL + C</code> <code>CTRL + V</code> it. /s</p>\n", "date_published": "2021-10-01T00:00:00Z", "date_modified": "2024-01-26T00:00:00Z", "url": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/blog/Creating_HTML_DD_List.html"}, {"id": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/blog/Youtube_needs_a_Rest_API.html", "title": "JSON Feed version 1.1", "icon": "https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org/favicon.ico", "content_html": "<p><em>2024 Note: I don't care anymore.
