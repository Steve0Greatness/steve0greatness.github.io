title: Merging the Blog repo in the main one
date: 2021 Sep 16

The blog for the repository has recently been merged into the main one, it used to be it's own repository, but now it's part of <a href="https://github.com/steve0greatness/steve0greatness.github.io">this repo</a>.<br>I hope this change isn't horrible, I did it for the simple fact that it makes the whole site easier to make, just because of the fact that I don't need to make 2 repls that have the same look, and are for the same site.<br>The <a href="https://github.com/steve0greatness/blog">blog repo</a> is now read only, or archived, and has been unpinned from my <a href="https://github.com/steve0greatness">profile</a>. This shouldn't cause any slowdowns for the site.
