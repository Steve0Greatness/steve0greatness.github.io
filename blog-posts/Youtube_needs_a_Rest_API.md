*2024 Note: I don't care anymore. I'm keeping this around for historical reasons at this point.*

Youtube needs an open Rest API. Here are some reasons:
1. It makes my life easier, as I don't need to write a billion lines of code, and not go thought the ***paid service*** known as google cloud console, to get an api key.
2. It means that you only need to use `fetch()` on it.
3. We don't need the most in depth api.
