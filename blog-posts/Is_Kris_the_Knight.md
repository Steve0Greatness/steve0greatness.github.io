Is Kris <span style='color: hotpink; font-style: italic;'>the Knight</span>? At face value, this seemes insain. Right? Well, let's look at the evidence<br>First and formost, <span style='color: hotpink; font-style: italic;'>the Knight</span> opens <span style='color: red; font-style: italic;'>Dark Fountains</span>. Now, what does Kris do at the end of Chapter 2? They create a <span style='color: red; font-style: italic;'>Dark Fountain</span>.<br>Second, what does Kris look like in <span style='color: red; font-style: italic;'>Dark Worlds</span>? That's right, a Knight.<br><img src='https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/deltarune/images/9/96/Kris_overworld_darkworld.png' width='100' align='left'>This is what Kris looks like in a <span style='color: red; font-style: italic;'>Dark World</span>, they're wearing plated armor. They even have a sword(not shown in image).<br>We know that Kris made a <span style='color: red; font-style: italic;'>Dark Fountain</span> at the end of Chapter 2, so is it really that far off to assume that they also made the one in the librarby's computer lab? Or the on in the closet for that matter. Well, we know that they had thier knife at the <a href='https://youtu.be/wBS1MNkVPGw'>end of chapter 1</a>, and only Toby Fox knows what they did before chapter 1.<br>In the end of chapter 2, they rips they soul out before creating the new fountain, and shuffeling around outside; and slashing Torial's tires. Infact, they rips out their heart in the end of chapter 1, too. Afterward, they presumably went to librarby and made a fountain in the computer lab.<br>This is a really common thereoy, but it really needs more evidence to be collected, and more speculating to be done.<br clear='left'><span style='color: grey; font-size: 13px;'>taken from <a href='https://deltarune.fandom.com/wiki/'>Fandom</a>.</span>
