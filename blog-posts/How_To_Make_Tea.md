*This post is subjective, there's no **right** answer to "what is the perfect tea."*

Tea is the perfect fit for most meals, breakfast, 2nd breakfast, morning tea, lunch, afTernoon tea, dinner, or supper.

But how do I make it? Here's how I make my tea.

## Step 1

The first step is to get the brand of tea you like. I personally like stuff such as Mighty Leaf, it tastes strong, and your able to use it 3 times without it getting weaker, and even then, you can still use it more, it really doesn't lose it's weakness.

## Step 2

Get a mug, or tea cup. I personally like mugs, as they are normally bigger, meaning you don't have to refill as much as a tea cup.

## Step 3

Get your tea, if you're using loose leaf, I'd use a smaller cup to make it, then use a strainer to the leaves out, as it adds texture that I don't like personally, otherwise just put the tea bag in, it is at this point that I like to stir it.

## Final Step

Enjoy.

You can add sugar and <s>milk</s> cream, if you're into those kinda things... even lemon if you really want.
