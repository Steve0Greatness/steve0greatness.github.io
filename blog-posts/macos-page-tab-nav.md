Ok, so I feel like a complete idiot right now.

I've been trying to use `Tab` to navigate webpages on my MacBook for what feels like forever now. Turns out, it was as simple as hitting `Ctrl` + `F7`.

To be honest, I thought that it was just an issue with FireFox, and then I read [Browser keyboard navigation in macOS](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/macos-browser-keyboard-navigation/) by The A11Y Project and realized that it was an issue with MacOS! This should really be enabled by default, but Apple is stupid.
