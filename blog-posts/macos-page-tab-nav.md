Ok, so I feel like a complete idiot right now.

When I've been trying(and failing) to use `Tab` on my computer(it's a Macbook) for what feels like forever now. Turns out, it was as simple as hitting `Ctrl` + `F7`.

To be honest, I thought that it was just an issue with FireFox, and then I read [Browser keyboard navigation in macOS](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/macos-browser-keyboard-navigation/) and realized that it was an issue with MacOS! This should really be an option enabled by default, but Apple is stupid.
