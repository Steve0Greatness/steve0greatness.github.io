title: How to Make Scratch Mockups

The first step to making a mockup is to open the <abbr title="Developer Tools">[DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)</abbr>. This can be done with the keyboard shortcuts `ctrl` + `shift` + `i` or `F12`.

This DevTools menu allows you to do many cool things, such as create new elements, and modify existing ones. In all browsers(that I know of) you can use a little selector at the top-left of the DevTools panel to enable a mode that if you click on an area of the screen, it brings you to the element in question within the DevTools panel.

There's not much else advice I can give you. Just look around the Scratch site to get inspiration, and then either create or edit an element on a page you like to fit your needs.
