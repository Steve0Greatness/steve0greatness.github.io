<div class="notice">This post isn't very good, and I'm not proud of it.</div>

Recently, I've been seeing a lot of people coming up with one excuse for not linking the duplicate topic in the suggestions forum. They say something like, <q>I'm on mobile!!!!! &#128534;&#128557;&#128555;</q> this is not a correct argument, so I've decided to make this post to prove it.

## Safari/iOS

The way that you copy and paste on Safari is by double taping on the text, then dragging until you've selected all the text(the next bit works for links, not this)

### Coping links

Tap and hold on the link until you see:

### Paste
Going to any textbox, in the top-lefT-hand conner, you should see a little clipboard icon(as long as you aren't selecting any text), press it. tap "copy"(circled in red)"

## Chrome/Android

*Note: I don't own an android tablet or phone, so take this with a grain of salt*

Press and hold until a few selection boxes come up(might work for links)

**Chromium**

**Firefox/Gecko**

### Pasting

Tap and hold on the text box, you should see "paste," now click that(highlighted in red).
