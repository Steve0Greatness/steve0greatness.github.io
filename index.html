At this point in time, I do not feel it is possible to begin
hosting my site using another forge.

However, most simply do not have what my site needs: CI/CD.

My site is what's called a statically generated site.
Basically: it's compiled to HTML using Python(and some
libraries). This lets me contribute to my website without
needing to write every line of HTML by hand(which can be
time consuming).

While it does contribute to an overall fairly uniform looking
website, it works well for my purposes.

Anyway, my website is at steve0greatness.github.io, not here.
And while I'd love to host it somewhere else, I don't really
feel up to it.

Thanks!
