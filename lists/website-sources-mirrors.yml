    paragraph: I'm not gonna add to this list of mirrors anymore. I'm thinking I'm gonna start pretty much exclusively distributing my site on <a href="https://steve0greatness.nekoweb.org">Nekoweb</a>. It's a bit easier for me to maintain. The GitHub mirror will still be semi-up-to-date, but it may be behind the Nekoweb one(it's just easier to leave it as it is, at least for me).
