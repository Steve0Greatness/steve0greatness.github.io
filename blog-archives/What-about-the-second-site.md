So you may know about <a href="https://stevesgreatness.repl.co">StevesGreatness.Repl.Co</a>, or, the second site.<br>It contains more than what this one does, but also less. It doesn't have a blog, information about my alts on Scratch, or even addition projects. However, it does have a page for testing, an about me, a list of my accounts on other sites, and a list of my repls(which I want to eventually turn into a list of my repos, and Scratch projects as well).
